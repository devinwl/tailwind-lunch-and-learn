- Tailwind is a utility-first framework which is a fancy way of saying it provides a suite of utility classes to build an interface.
- When using only utility classes, there are no opinionated components.
- What's considered an opinionated component? For example, Bootstrap has utility classes but comes with its components built out â€” it's opinionated on how buttons look for example. When using the `btn` class, the look is decided for you.
