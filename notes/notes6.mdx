- Out the gate Tailwind uses a customizable design system for each of its classes. Every aspect can be tweaked to match an existing design system using a config file.
- The design system is consisent across all classes: spacing values for margin and padding are the same values even though they are using different CSS properties. This spacing is consistent in almost every other class too. You can expect `-2` to behave the same.
- The included design system is responsive supporting a variety of breakpoints. More breakpoints can be added if required.
- The footprint (after purging) is small, and only keeps the classes you use.
- Everything can be stored in one file. No more searching for the right CSS file.
- When necessary, custom elements can be added to support specific use-cases. Complicated components might require arbitrary style values.
