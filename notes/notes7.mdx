- If large amounts of arbitrary style is going to be necessary in order to style a component, Tailwind might is not the best choice. Tailwind is meant to be used as a design system, and it does have tools to break out of that system when needed. If you find yourself breaking out of the system frequently, there may be a different problem to solve.
- It's a new framework and requires developer buy-in before proceeding. There is a fair bit to learn first.
- If the design system is not set in stone, something else would be better. Tailwind shines when everything follows a design system, and if individual tweaks are consistently necessary then it gets messy fast (see point 1).
- If your CSS skills are shaky (or new), then Tailwind is not for you. It requires a strong understanding of CSS before the power of Tailwind is unlocked. This means potentially having to learn CSS on top of Tailwind itself â€” a lot at once!
- If you prefer using something else, use that instead! Tailwind is gaining in popularity, but there are other options that are better suited.
- Side note: If you've tried Tailwind before and didn't like it, try again. The Tailwind developers have added a lot of cool features that enrich the ecosystem like JIT (just-in-time compilation), arbitrary values, CSS purging, and more.
