- As mentioned earlier, Tailwind supports responsive design. The developers added what they call "variants" to support a media-query like system for toggling various utility classes.
- For example, here are popular variants for responsive style: `sm`, `md`, and `lg`. These can be combined with utility classes to toggle certain classes on or off depending on the screen size:
- In this example, the `div` has `100%` width when on phone sizes, and desktop sizes have `auto` width.
- Not every class has a variant by default, but can be enabled by modifying the Tailwind config.
- I'll add the width classes to the login component to demo the responsive behaviour.
