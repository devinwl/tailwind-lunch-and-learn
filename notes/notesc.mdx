- I can sense questions cropping up. I might be able to answer them ahead of time:
- "I need to follow a different design system!"
  - That's okay, every part of Tailwind can be customized, like the size of the spacing, the default font sizes, when breakpoints are triggered, and more!
- "I need to use arbitrary CSS to get this element working!"
  - Odds are you can accomplish what you need to do with arbitrary value syntax.
  - Note that JIT mode needs to be enabled to support this (JIT will become the default in an upcoming version of Tailwind).
