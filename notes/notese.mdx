- Tailwind has a rich plugin ecosystem. There are official plugins that add convenient features. Two of my favourites are "typography" and "aspect-ratio".
- The typography plugin adds a `prose` class (with variants for small, medium, large, and other screen sizes) that adds sensible defaults for spacing, font weight, and everything else related to typography. The best use case I've seen this for is when pulling content from a CMS that has been converted to HTML (it was made for Markdown).
- The aspect-ratio plugin is a utility plugin that gives elements a fixed aspect ratio (e.g. `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9` gives a 16:9 aspect ratio.). It's great for video embeds that need to maintain a specific aspect ratio.
- Tailwind publish a set of predefined and reusable UI components on Tailwind UI. The entire set costs money, but there are free versions available for components like buttons, lists, and forms.
- I could see potentially in the future MetaLab defining their own UI library that designers could pull from and tweak within preset options that developers would be able to use.
- I think Tailwind has a lot of potential for front-end developers and designers to standardize and collaborate together.
