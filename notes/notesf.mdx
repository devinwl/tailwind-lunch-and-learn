- There are tools available that help improve the developer experience.
- There is `twin.macro` and `twind` which accomplish a similar idea. It changes the syntax closer to styled components:
- `twin.macro` is a nice way to integrate both Tailwind and styled components together, if the project needs it.
- `twind` doesn't require Tailwind at all and converts all classes into CSS at runtime.
- Both of these packages have tradeoffs that need to be considered. They're not plug-and-play.
