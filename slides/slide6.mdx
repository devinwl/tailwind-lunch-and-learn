## Why even use Tailwind??

It has a highly customizable design system that applies to every class.

- e.g. `mb-2` and `pb-2` produce the same spacing values.

Adds responsive style.

CSS footprint is tiny after purging.

Style lives with components (kind of like Styled Components).

Added flexibility to break out of the design system when necessary.
