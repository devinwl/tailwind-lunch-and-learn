## What is `@apply`?

Here is our complicated button class from before as a component class:

```css
.btn {
  @apply bg-indigo-600 text-white px-4 py-1 rounded hover:bg-indigo-800 active:bg-indigo-900 transform active:translate-y-1 transition hover:ring-2 hover:ring-indigo-400;
}
```

We can then use this class like we would with Bootstrap:

```jsx
<div className="btn">Hello</div>
```
