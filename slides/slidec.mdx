## This is great, but what if...

- I need to follow a different design system?
  - No problem, every part of Tailwind's design system is customizable.
- I need to use arbitrary values that Tailwind doesn't have!
  - Odds are you can accomplish what you need with Tailwind's "arbitrary value" syntax:
  ```jsx
  <img class="absolute w-[762px] h-[918px] top-[-325px] right-[62px] md:top-[-400px] md:right-[80px]" src="/crazy-background-image.png">
  ```
  - N.B. Enable "JIT mode" before trying this.
