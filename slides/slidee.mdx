## What else can Tailwind do?

Tailwind offers a rich plugin ecosystem. They provide official plugins too.

The `typography` plugin adds a `prose` class and opinionated defaults on how type should look.

The `aspect-ratio` plugin adds a utility class to allow elements to maintain an aspect ratio (e.g. `aspect-w-16 aspect-h-9` => `16:9` aspect ratio).

Tailwind provides a huge set of UI components (similar to Bootstrap). The entire package is paid, but they offer a limited set of free ones.

Potential for MetaLab to adopt Tailwind and define a customizable design system and standard UI library. A lot of potential for designer and developer collaboration.
